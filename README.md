The idea behind this project is to combine the simplicity and style from the notepad and the text formatting functions of the word, while being able to handle all or most of the text file extensions in one app.
The reason for this is because I got pissed at how I couldn't style my text in notepad and I then switched to word and word is just too cluttered and awful to work with, so here are we.
